#Enforce

Enforce is a simple Python 3.5 (or higher) application for enforcing a runtime
type checking based on type hints (PEP 484).

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Enforce Wiki](https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce/wiki)

##Installation

Stable 0.2 - Already suitable for majority of applications.

    pip install enforce

Dev current - "Bleeding edge" features that, while are fairly consistent, may
change.

    pip install git+https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce.git@dev

## Usage

Type enforcement is done using decorators around functions that you desire to be
checked. By default, this decorator will ensure that any variables passed into
the function call match its declaration. This includes integers, strings, etc.
as well as lists, dictionaries, and more complex objects.

Note, this behavior means that for a large nested structure, every item in that
structure will be checked. This may be a nightmare for performance! See
[caveats](#caveats) for more details.

You can also apply the `runtime_validation` decorator around a class, and it
will enforce the types of every method in that class. **Note**, this is a
development feature and is not as thoroughly tested as the function decorators.

### Features

#### Basic type hint enforcement

```python
>>> import enforce
>>> @enforce.runtime_validation
... def foo(text: str) -> None:
...     print(text)
>>> foo('Hello World')
Hello World
>>> foo(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/william/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/enforce/decorators.py", line 106, in universal
    _args, _kwargs = enforcer.validate_inputs(parameters)
  File "/home/william/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/enforce/enforcers.py", line 69, in validate_inputs
    raise RuntimeTypeError(exception_text)
enforce.exceptions.RuntimeTypeError: 
  The following runtime type errors were encountered:
       Argument 'text' was not of type <class 'str'>. Actual type was <class 'int'>.
```

#### Decorator Configuration

You can assign functions to groups, and apply options on the group level.

```python
# Basic Example
@runtime_validation(group='best group', enable=True)
def foo(a: List[str]):
    pass

# Group Configuration
enforce.config(enable=False)  # Disables all checks
enforce.set_group('foo', True)  # Enables the foo group

@runtime_validation(group='foo')
def test1(a: typing.List[str]): return a

@runtime_validation(group='foo')
def test2(a: typing.List[str]): return a

@runtime_validation(group='bar')
def test3(a: typing.List[str]): return a

with self.assertRaises(RuntimeTypeError):
    test1(5)

with self.assertRaises(RuntimeTypeError):
    test2(5)

test3(5)

enforce.config(enable=True)  # Re-enables all checks
```

#### Callable Support

```python
@runtime_validation
def foo(a: typing.Callable[[int, int], str]) -> str:
    return a(5, 6)

def bar(a: int, b: int) -> str:
    return str(a * b)
foo(bar)
```

#### Class Decorator

Applying this decorator to a class will automatically apply the decorator to
every method in the class.

```python
@runtime_validation
class DoTheThing(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.do_the_stuff(5, 6.0)

    def do_the_stuff(self, a: int, b: float) -> str:
        return str(a * b)
```

### Caveats

Enabling/Disabling type checking via group tags is done at initialisation, *not*
at runtime. This is a known issue that is in the process of being fixed. At a
high level, this means that it's not quite supported to dynamically disable
checking at runtime, and this toggle feature works best manually for now.

We are still working on deciding the best approach for iterables, please
reference [PR #15](https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce/pull/15) for context.

Currently the type checker will examine every object in a list. This means that
for large structures performance can be a nightmare. A known feature request
(that is in the works) is to set the recursion limit as well as a maximum size
limit, as to not have to check every item in some arbitrary object
(essentially trading performance for type safety). Another viable option is to check the
contents of lists lazily. This is a preferred method and would become a default one when implemented.

Generics and containers are NOT yet supported. Callables and TypeVars should be
generally supported (including covariacne and contravariance).

Class decorators are not as well tested, and you may encounter a bug or two.
Please report an issue if you do find one and we'll try to fix it as quickly as
possible.

Actual development is done in the 'dev' branch, which is merged to master at
milestones.
